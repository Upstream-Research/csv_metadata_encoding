# CSV Metadata Encoding Specification

Copyright (c) 2018 Upstream Research, Inc.

This repository hosts a specification for encoding metadata associated with a CSV (tabular data document).

The specification provided here is subject to an MIT License.

A python script called `csv-mkmeta` is provided, 
which infers "schema" information from a CSV file and generates
appropriate metadata files accordingly.
